Left click/Right click: Put down first/second point

Tickbox "Path": Show shortest path (this will automatically run if the path is not found yet)
Tickbox "Graph": Show the graph of all posible movement

Radio button "None" "Index" "Position": Show nothing/index/position of each vertice that make up the map

"Clear All Vertices": Clear the map of all vertices
"Start Draw Session": Start drawing your own map! (This will clear the current map)
   - Left click: add a point to the map
   - Right click: End the drawing (Note: This will not work if the first point and last point cannot be connected)

"Export Graph": Return a text that is the list of all vertices that make up the current map
"Import Graph": Get the list on the textbox, then turn it into a map (should only be used with import graph. deepcopy is used)

"Generate Map": Automatically create a maze with inputed height and width
"Auto run on load": When a map is done generating, a run will instantly happen. Good if you know your first and second point will always be on the map
"Maintain aspect ratio": If you don't like "generate map" to stretch the thing out to fit the screen out, use this

"Full Run/Rerun": If a map exist, and both point is in the map, run a dijkstra code to search for the path between the two point


UI:
- Dijkstra: Time it took to run Dijkstra
- Graph: Time it took to graph out all the posible path from the map
