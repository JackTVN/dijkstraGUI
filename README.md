# dijkstraGUI

dijkstraGUI is a project done by me to have fun with a Python's Library known as tKinter. This respository is meant to be more as an archive, and so will look a bit basic. A completed .exe build is in there for those who want to have fun, and the code is also in with comments! An instruction .txt was supposed to be made but is not completed yet.
